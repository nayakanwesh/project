<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" target="_blank">Plasma</a> is one of four fundamental states of matter, characterized by the presence of a 
significant portion of charged particles in any combination of ions or electrons. It is
 the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe, being mostly associated with stars,
  including the Sun. Extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly to intergalactic
   regions, plasma can be artificially generated by heating a neutral gas or subjecting it to a 
   strong electromagnetic field.<hr> The presence of charged particles makes plasma electrically conductive, 
   and its response to electromagnetic fields is used in many modern devices and technologies, such as 
   plasma televisions or plasma etching. This photograph shows a plasma ball, a clear glass container
    filled with a mixture of various noble gases with a high-voltage electrode in the center of the container.
     When voltage is applied, a plasma is formed within the container. Plasma filaments extend from the inner 
     electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of multiple constant beams of colored light.
      Plasma balls were popular as novelty items in the 1980s.</p>
